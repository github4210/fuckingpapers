# Paper Glance

> Papers about AI. Including from CV and NLP to advanced Reinforcement Learning papers.



I am gather all newest or classic papers here to review it. I will write very markdown notes on all papers which I read. I am now make research on mainly computer vision area but also other area that I am interested. Welcome to add your notes to this repo and let more people to understand the amazing work made by genius everyday!



## cv

### segmentation

this part is about segmentation. from the last decade years, segmentation really did a very good job on this task. the state-of-art atrous convolution based *deeplab* system are very impressive. Let's take a travel!
